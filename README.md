# 1-1-1 Static Webpack Build
## 1 HTML file, 1 CSS file, 1 JS file

If you want a simple setup where you only need one HTML file, one CSS/SCSS file, and one JS file, then this is the build for you. Simply edit main.html/main.scss/main.js and Webpack will spit out a minified set of static files into your dist folder.

### Setup

* git clone http
* npm install
